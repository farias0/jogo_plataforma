# Jogo de plataforma

## Observations

* The game should be ran from the `build` directory, one level above the project's base directory. Currently it depends on the source code for assets and stuff.

* Use the Github Actions workflow file for reference on dependencies.

## Controls

The game and editor controls can currently be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/farias0/jogo_plataforma/wiki/Controles).
